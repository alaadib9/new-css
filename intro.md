The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.

  The CSS box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

CSS Flexbox Layout Module
Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

Block, for sections in a webpage
Inline, for text
Table, for two-dimensional table data
Positioned, for explicit position of an element

The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container.

An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
